Send to Kindler for linux 

I use linux as primary OS and i bought an amazon kindle as well. I really love my kindle but there wasn't really any linux program that would let me send a pdf to it. So i decided to code one using python and GTK3 that uses a mail server to send my books to the Kindle through an amazon email. The main script is EnvioKindler.py

**Maybe the api to send the books is deprecated**
